# statlab

> Statistical-arbitrage research platform & event-driven backtester — built to research
> a cointegration-based pairs-trading strategy with **research rigor**: no lookahead bias,
> realistic transaction costs, and honest out-of-sample evaluation.

**What / Why / Results (30-second version)**

- **What:** an end-to-end quant workflow — data pipeline → signal research (cointegration
  + Kalman-filter hedge ratios) → event-driven backtester with realistic costs →
  walk-forward validation → HTML tear sheet.
- **Why it's different:** most candidate "backtests" are toy vectorized loops that ignore
  costs and leak future information. This one treats sloppy backtesting as a bug:
  point-in-time data, next-bar fills, square-root market-impact costs, and strict
  train/test separation.
- **Results:** _(populated as milestones land — see `BENCHMARKS.md` / the tear sheet)._

## Status

Built milestone by milestone. Current: **M1 — skeleton, tooling, and a synthetic
data generator** so the entire suite and demo run offline with no data download.

| Milestone | Scope | State |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| M1 | Repo skeleton, uv/ruff/mypy/pytest CI, synthetic OU data generator | ✅ |
| M2 | Data layer + `PointInTimeUniverse` + `test_no_lookahead.py` | ⬜ |
| M3 | Cointegration (Engle-Granger, Johansen), half-life, Kalman filter | ⬜ |
| M4 | Event-driven backtester + portfolio-accounting invariants + cost model | ⬜ |
| M5 | Strategy wiring + single-pair known-answer backtests | ⬜ |
| M6 | Walk-forward + sensitivity grid + deflated Sharpe | ⬜ |
| M7 | HTML tear sheet + notebooks + `make reproduce` | ⬜ |
| M8 | Polished docs, honest results discussion, architecture diagram | ⬜ |

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) then:
make install        # sync deps into a local .venv
make check          # lint + typecheck + test (the full CI gate)

# Generate offline synthetic data (a universe with known cointegrated pairs):
uv run statlab gen-synth --out data/synthetic/panel.parquet --seed 7
```

## Design principles

1. **No lookahead bias.** Any query as of date *T* only sees data available at *T*
   (`PointInTimeUniverse`, arriving in M2), and a dedicated `test_no_lookahead.py` proves
   future data cannot leak through any public API.
2. **Realistic costs.** Fills at the *next* bar; cost = commission + half-spread +
   square-root market impact `η·σ·√(Q/ADV)`.
3. **Reproducibility.** Seeded RNG passed explicitly (never global state), pinned deps via
   `uv.lock`, and `make reproduce` regenerates every artifact.
4. **Honesty.** An honest marginal/negative result with correct methodology beats an
   inflated backtest. Limitations are documented, not hidden.
